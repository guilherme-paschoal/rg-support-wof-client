# RG Support Wheel of Fate Client

This is a small client application that I built very quickly with React + Redux and Bootstrap(css) intented to be used with the RG Support Wheel of Fate Api 

## To use this

The app is deployed to Azure. Just visit http://rgsupportwof.azurewebsites.net/

## To use the code

- Make sure you get the api first: https://github.com/guilherme-paschoal/rg-support-wof-api
- Run the Api, make sure it's executing on `http://localhost:5000`, otherwise, please change the url string in `config/environment.js`
- Clone the Repository
- Run `npm install` on the directory where you pulled this app to
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (if it doesn't automatically)
- Click the button
- Check the users and go take a look at the API code if you haven't yet
- Be happy and think Wow, this dude is great!
